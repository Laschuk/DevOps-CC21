# An Identity and Access Management (IAM) role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account 
# that has specific permissions. An IAM role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS identity 
# with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead 
# of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs 
# it. Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys 
# associated with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security 
# credentials for your role session.

# Amazon EKS managed node groups automate the provisioning and lifecycle management of nodes 
# (Amazon EC2 instances) for Amazon EKS Kubernetes clusters.
# With Amazon EKS managed node groups, you donâ€™t need to separately provision or register the Amazon EC2
# instances that provide compute capacity to run your Kubernetes applications. You can create, 
# automatically update, or terminate nodes for your cluster with a single operation.
