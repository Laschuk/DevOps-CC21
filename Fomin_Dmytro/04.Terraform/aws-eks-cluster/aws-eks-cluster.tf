# Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes 
# on AWS (Amazon Web Services) without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own 
# Kubernetes control plane or nodes. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the 
# deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
