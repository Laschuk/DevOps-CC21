# Amazon EKS managed node groups automate the provisioning and lifecycle management of nodes (Amazon EC2 instances) 
# for Amazon EKS Kubernetes clusters.
# With Amazon EKS managed node groups, you donâ€™t need to separately provision or register the Amazon EC2 instances 
# that provide compute capacity to run your Kubernetes applications. You can create, automatically update, or terminate
# nodes for your cluster with a single operation. Node updates and terminations automatically drain nodes to ensure 
# that your applications stay available.
